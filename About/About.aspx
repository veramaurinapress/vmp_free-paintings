<h3>Welcome to Vera Maurina Press. We believe text-paintings belong distributed 
    throughout many viewers’ homes, not hidden in elite collections. That’s why 
    we’re making it easy for you to own some durable art: 
    <span class="BigText"><a id="A1" href="~/" runat="server">upload one digital image</a></span>
    after entering your email, and we will send you five original paintings. 
    <a href="~/Macro/" runat="server"><span class="BigText">Here&#39;s 
    some samples.</span></a></h3>(Future functionality on this site will allow you to select from a stock of existing paintings, or select a color palette so we can create for you a new painting to harmonize with your living or work space’s existing color scheme, so check back for updates.)
    <br />
<br />
<span class="BigText">This is not a hoax.</span> <h4>We don’t want your credit card number, and we’re not trying to sell your email address to spammers.
<span class="BigText">We actually mean it</span> when we say that art is and must be the property of all its viewers.
Paintings must be looked at and lived with, not merely known about and sold.
The reason we’re requesting an image of a Network in exchange for our paintings we want you to own is that we hope to acquire enough such images to create an original collaborative artwork out of them.  If we accomplish this, that work will be displayed on this site.
Additionally, we think the minimal requirement of obtaining or creating, and uploading, an image of a Network ensures that our paintings are going to good people, who’ve demonstrated an interest in this project, and who will thus treat their paintings with openness and care.
<br /><br />
It’s 2011.  This is Vera Maurina Press.  Forget your feelings about art.  Put some poetry on your living walls.  And get on with being alive every week at THIS iota of immanently developing collective destiny.
